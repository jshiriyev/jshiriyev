# Hello, I'm Javid Shiriyev 👋

A professional engaged at the intersection of industry and academia, currently serving as a **Field Development Lead at SOCAR Upstream** while also teaching at **Baku Higher Oil School**. 

My work focuses on practical solutions in the oil and gas industry. I develop methodologies, tools, and workflows that help enhance reservoir management, production forecasting, and formation evaluation. My academic contributions include courses on:

- **Formation Evaluation**
- **Advanced Fluid Mechanics and Modeling**
- **Reservoir Simulation**
- **Reservoir Modeling and Management**

## 📂 Repository Categories

I organize my repositories into three main groups:

1. **Study Packages** 📖
   - Notebooks designed for self-practice in **Python, Numerical Analysis (Modeling), Statistics, and Machine Learning**.

2. **Main Packages** 🛠️
   - Developments addressing critical **oil and gas industry challenges**, including:
     - Formation Evaluation (main-pphys)
     - Borehole Modeling (main-borepy)
     - Well Performance Analysis (main-nodepy)
     - Reservoir Characterization (main-geom)
     - Material Balance Calculations (main-pormed)
     - Reservoir Simulation (main-respy)
     - Production Forecasting (main-prodpy)

3. **Stream Packages** 🌐
   - Interfaces built on **main packages** that facilitate **easy presentation and interpretation of results**.
